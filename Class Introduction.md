# Class Introduction

- This is the site for the July 2024 IRS class _Test Management with RQM_.
- During the introductions, take a moment to tell me about the specific results you want this class to produce for you once you get back into the real world.
- If the class wants to cover material that is important to them but was not in the original plan, I will add the content as we go.


## Logistics

- The class runs from 9am to 5pm from July 8 to July 9
- Lunch is from noon to 1pm without fail. This gives you a predictable block of time to manage out of class issues like returning calls and scheduling meetings.
- There is a 15min break mid-morning-ish and another mid-afternoon-ish. The actual time will depend on where we are in the flow of the material.
- There will be no new material presented after 4pm unless we are running behind schedule. The last hour will be reserved for additional topics, individual help and to answer questions

## Pre-tests and Post-tests

- The IRS requires that you complete a pre-test before the class begins and a post-test at the end of the class.
- The tests are anonymous—there is no way to identify what tests are yours
- The reported scores will be the average score of the class as a whole
- The instructor will provide the URL for the tests

1. You will have 10 minutes to complete the test 
2. You may not consult any reference materials or look up the answers online.
3. You may not consult anyone else—the test measures what is currently in your brain.
4. **Do not guess!** If you don't know the answer, select the "Do not know" option. Good guessers can skew the results, so they are less accurate.

Please introduce yourself briefly using the following as a guide.
- Name you prefer to be called in class, if different from the one listed on the class list
- Your area of professions focus (developer, SRE, tester, BA, hardware engineer, etc.)
- Any experience you have with Engineering Lifecycle Management, RQM and Software Testing

## Class Materials

- This repository will be the primary resource for the class. The materials are freely available until August 9, 2024.

## VMS

- You will each be provided with a VM and your own copy of RQM. 
- In the first lab, the instructor will walk you through the process of logging into the VM and starting the application
- The VMs will be available continuously until at least 6pm on July 9.

## Class Protocols

The measure of how effective this class is how much you learn as opposed to the amount of material thrown at you during these four days.

In keeping with that, my classes are run under the following protocols.

- __Questions are ALWAYS appropriate.__ Ask questions when they occur to you and are fresh in your mind. Normally, I notice when someone raises their hand, but I don't seem to have notices, then do unmute yourself and get my attention.
- At various points during the class, I will run through the participant list and check to see how you are coming along with the material. This is my measure of how well we are doing as a class, so if you feel lost or confused, this is when you tell me. Almost always, if you are confused, it's because I didn't explain something well enough.
- If you know in advance that if you are going to be late or away for part of the class, let me know in advance, so I don't hold the class up waiting.
- __Have Fun!!!__
